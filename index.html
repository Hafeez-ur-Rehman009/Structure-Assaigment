<h4>Understanding structure<br />

<br />
Tags and element</h4>
<p>We come across all kinds of documents <br />
every day of our lives. Newspapers, <br />
insurance forms, shop catalogues... <br />the 
list goes on.<br />
<br />
Many web pages act like electronic versions of these<br /> 
documents. For example, newspapers show the same stories <br />
in print as they do on websites; you can apply for insurance <br />
over the web; and stores have online catalogs and e-commerce <br />
facilities.<br />
<br />
In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping <br />
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey <br />
and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how <br />
to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to <br />
structure documents. In this chapter you will:<br />
<br />

<h1><u>Summary</u></h1>
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>HTML</b> pages are text documents.<br /></li>
<br />
<li> <b>HTML</b> uses tags <b><u>(characters that sit inside angled 
brackets)</b></u> to give the information they surround special 
meaning.<br /></li>
<br />
<li> <b>Tags</b> are often referred to as <b>elements.</b><br /></li>
<br />
 <li><b>Tags</b> usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end.<br /></li>
<br />
 <li> <b>Opening tags</b> can carry attributes, which tell us more 
about the content of that<b> element.</b><br /></li>
<br />
 <b>Attributes</b> require a name and a value.<br />
<br />
 To learn<b> HTML</b> you need to know what tags are 
available for you to use, what they do, and where they 
can go.<br />
<br />
